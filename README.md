This is a repository for our Integrability and Beyond!!! Seminar at Tulane, with cryptic, hard-to-read notes, matlab code, and mathematica files.  
The matlab files are very simple, and generate random matrices, then histograms of the eigenvalues.
The mathematica file computes some Fredholm determinants.
These notes are intended for the use of the participants in our seminar, and come with no gaurantees as to correctness.
